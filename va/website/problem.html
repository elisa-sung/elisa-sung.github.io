      <div class="text">The earth is 4.6 billions years old. Scaling to 46 years, humans have been around for 4 minutes. Our industrial revolution began just one minute ago. In that time, we have destroyed 83% of wild mammals and 50% of the world's forests and is continuing to do so. This is not sustainable.</div>

    <div class="text">For example, the landfill is another victim of the world’s clothes culture. The term ‘fast fashion’ refers to the term we use to describe the cheaply produced garments that mimic the clothes we see on the catwalk. These garments are distributed quickly across the globe to fuel existing trends. They are, however, thrown away as fast as they are distributed as trends come and go. The clothes that are abandoned end up in landfills, where they are left to biodegrade over a course of hundreds of years. During this time period, the decomposition of clothes releases a harmful gas known as methane, which then contributes to global warming. The average Australian shopper throws out 85% of the textiles they purchase annually, a result of consuming 400% more clothes than we did 20 years ago. This only means more clothes in a landfill. More pollution. Less space in landfills.

    <div class="text">Like most things, when we decide to throw away any electronics because you have a better quality camera now, we don’t think about the impacts that one camera could have on the wildlife, environment and health. Lead, mercury and arsenic are a few examples of substances found in e-waste. Lead, when found in high concentrations in one’s blood, may cause cancer, behavioural problems and even death. When 1/70th of a teaspoon of mercury is discharged in a large lake, the fish population residing in that lake is deemed unsafe to consume. Arsenic is carcinogenic when discharged into the atmosphere as e-waste is burnt, thus affecting the soil and air.
