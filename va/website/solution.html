<div class="bg-text">Our solution is having one day that everyone brings something from home to trade with someone else. The purpose of this day is to waste less things by giving them to other people who might want them. Most of the things we throw away are in good quality but end up in landfills. These things include clothes, stationery, cameras, etc. By bringing these things in instead of throwing them away, you are giving them a longer and new life. This helps the environment as waste produces greenhouse gases when they decompose which contributes to global warming. By swapping things, we end up not needing to buy them and we throw out fewer things overall.</div>
